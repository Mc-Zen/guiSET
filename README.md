# guiSET - Preparing the docs and registration at the moment
Create advanced graphical user interfaces in Processing  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    ([Website](https://mc-zen.github.io/guiSET/), [Wiki](https://mc-zen.github.io/guiSET/webpage/wiki/wiki.html), [Getting started](https://mc-zen.github.io/guiSET/webpage/wiki/introduction-for-beginners.html))

### Little Introduction (history):

Ok, so once I was working on a rather complex project with Processing and badly needed some GUI functionality such as a multi-line textbox, special lists, individual styling etc. and my requirements could not be satisfied with the existing libraries so I created the predecessor to this library. Over time the thing got bigger and as I had a lot of fun here I kept on developing this project. Now I thought I might as well share this with the great Processing community for everyone to use and improve. 


Visit the [webpage](https://mc-zen.github.io/guiSET/) for information :)

### What is this?

_guiSET_ is a large library to include proper **graphica** user interfaces_ in Processing sketches. It features quite a few classes to create Buttons, Textboxes, Lists, nested Containers and many more (for a complete list look [here](https://mc-zen.github.io/guiSET/webpage/wiki/list-of-components.html)).
The main goals of _guiSET_ are:
- Highly customizable styles
- Event Listeners and a lot of functionality
- Fairly simple and intuitive



If you're new to _guiSET_ take a look at the [Getting started](https://mc-zen.github.io/guiSET/webpage/wiki/introduction-for-beginners.html) and the [Examples](https://mc-zen.github.io/guiSET/webpage/examples/examples.html). 
Further elaborations and the main concept can be found [here](https://mc-zen.github.io/guiSET/webpage/wiki/creating-own-components.html) and [here](https://mc-zen.github.io/guiSET/webpage/wiki/the-deep-shit.html) if you want to develop own components or contribute to the library.
