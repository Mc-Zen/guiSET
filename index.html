            This library is intended for creating advanced graphical user interfaces in <a
                href="https://processing.org">Processing</a>.
            You can write Processing sketches with "empty draw loop", meaning using only this library to draw stuff. Or
            you can combine both: the traditional simplicity-oriented drawing in Processing

        <h2>
            Little Introduction:
        </h2>
        <p>
            Ok, so once I was working on a rather complex project with Processing and badly needed some GUI
            functionality such as a multi-line textbox, special lists, individual styling etc. and my requirements could
            not be satisfied with the existing libraries so I created the predecessor to this library. Over time the
            thing got bigger and as I had a lot of fun here I kept on developing this project. Now I thought I might as
            well share this with the great Processing community for everyone to use and improve.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What is this
        </h2>
        <p>
            <i>setGUI</i> is a large library to include proper graphical user interfaces in Processing sketches. It
            features quite a few classes to create Buttons, Textboxes, Lists, nested Containers and many more (for a
            complete list look here). The main goals of <i>setGUI</i> are:

            <ul>
                <li>Highly customizable styles</li>
                <li>Listeners and a lot of functionality</li>
                <li>Fairly simple and intuitive</li>
            </ul>


            If you're new to <i>setGUI</i> take a look at the Introduction and the Examples. Further elaborations and
            the main concept can be found here if you want to develop own Components or contribute to the library.
