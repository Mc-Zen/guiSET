            So you made it here. Congratulations!
        </p>
        <p>
            In this part I'll explain the deeper mechanics of the library. Maybe you're interested in contributing to
            the library; or want to create highly customized compontents; or you are just interested in how such a
            <code>Frame</code>work works. Then you're right here. Or perhaps you just came here by accidents or because
            of the
            obscure title ;). Nevermind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's get serious.
        </p>
        <p>
            Basically, the only thing Processing does for this library is drawing the stuff and provide some functions
            to draw text, rects, lines etc. How everything is arranged, which items come on top of others, when to
            render what, HOW the stuff should look like is what <b>guiSET</b> deals with. Processing also tells us when
            the
            user pressed a key or did something with the mouse. But we need to decide which items are allowed to process
            the mouse events and how it is determined if the mouse is over a specific element.

        <h1 id="s1">Short summary about the inheritance of the component classes</h1>
        <p>
            Control is the (abstract) base class for all visual components. Container subclasses Control. As do Button,
            Label, Checkbox, MenuItem, ListItem and Slider.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>Frame</code>, VFlowContainer, HFlowContainer, ScrollArea, ListView and FlowContainer all extend
            Container.
        </p>
        <p>
            V- and HScrollContainer subclass the according FlowContainers and MultilineTextbox and Textbox are
            extensions of these two.
        </p>





        <h1 id="s2">Graphics and updating</h1>
        <p>
            Each instance of a component has a <code>PGraphics</code> object that stores the current look as pixel
            image. Its content
            is only changed within the <code>render()</code> method. Containers draw the <code>PGraphics</code> of their
            children onto their own
            <code>PGraphics</code> and so on. The <code>Frame</code> instance finally draws itself onto the sketch (the
            <code>PApplet</code>).
        </p>
        <p>
            This way of rendering and storing is chosen to keep the number of drawing processes as low as possible. If
            an element is changed visually, <code>render()</code> will be called and thus the graphics updated. But any
            siblings or
            children do not need to be re-rendered as their look is still stored in their own <code>PGraphics</code>
            object. However,
            this comes at a prize of memory. This is not a problem with modern computers and moderate or even generous
            numbers of elements. If, nevertheless, you aspire to have a list with a few thousand items displayed on the
            screen, this technique can get expensive. I'm thinking about adding functionalty to enable rendering every
            time the graphics are required, without storing the image. This descision could be per-item.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each time the user of the library sets the state of a property that changes the look of the element, the
            setter will call the <code>update()</code> method which sets a <code>dirty</code> flag and also initiates a
            propagation through the
            tree structure way up to <code>Frame</code>, setting the <code>dirty</code> flag for every parent,
            'grand'-parent etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            At render time, <code>Frame</code> checks if it needs to redraw itself and if so, proceeds to render all
            changed children
            in the described way.
        </p>
        <p>
            A container is always responsible for drawing its content items. For that purpose, in its own
            <code>render()</code>
            method it calls the function <code><b>renderItem(Control c, int x, int y)</b></code> for each item,
            specifying with <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> where the item shall be placed on the containers own
            <code>PGraphics</code>. <code>renderItem(Control
            c, int x, int y)</code> takes care of checking if the item is '<code>dirty</code>' or (semi-) transparent
            (but does not check
            for visibility). Here is also where i.e. flow or scroll containers give their items a new location.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example this is what the implementation of <code>render()</code> in <code>Container</code> looks like.
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
@Override
protected void render() {
  drawDefaultBackground();

  for (Control c : content) {
    if (c.visible) {
      renderItem(c, c.x, c.y);
    }
  }
  drawDefaultDisabled();
}</pre>
        <p>
            In <code<VFlowContainer> the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties of the item are ignored and
                replaced by other rules:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
@Override
protected void render() {
  drawDefaultBackground();

  int usedSpace = paddingTop;

  for (Control c : items) {
    if (c.visible) {
      renderItem(c, c.marginLeft + paddingLeft, usedSpace + c.marginTop);
      usedSpace += (c.height + c.marginTop + c.marginBottom);
    }
  }
  drawDefaultDisabled();
}</pre>





        <h1 id="s3">More details about the render procedure</h1>
        <p>
            The actual rendering takes place like this: the container usually draws its own background and then calls
            <code>renderItem(Control c, int x ,int y)</code>. This method sets the offsetX/offsetY properties of <cdoe>c
            </cdoe> according to given
            coordinates and sets them outside the container if the opacity is 0. This is not necessary if visibility is
            set to false because mouseEvent(int, int) already checks for visiblity. If the graphics of <code>c</code>
            are
            "<code>dirty</code>",
            pre<code>render()</code> is called which creates the <code>PGraphics</code> instance (only if size has
            changed) and calls
            <code>pg.beginDraw()</code>. Then the items custom <code>render()</code> method is executed and finally tint
            applied for
            opacity.
        </p>




        <h1 id="s4">Mouse Events</h1>
        <p>
            <b>guiSET</b> uses relative coordinates (relative to parent) to make mouse event checks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Generally, mouse events are received by <code>Frame</code> from the sketch (<code>PApplet</code>). As a
            container it checks if the
            mouse is currently locally within the space it takes up and if so, passes the event on to all children which
            in turn do the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, it is sort of the other way round: After checking if mouse coordinates are within the containers
            bounds rectangle, it first gives the children the chance to process the event as they are always on top of
            and not below the container. Afterwards the container calls its own event routine.
        </p>
        <p>
            This way the topmost elements (high z-coordinate) in the application get the event first. They can then call
            <code>stopPropagation()</code> which sets a flag that no more mouse events should be processed. This way you
            can click on
            a menu item without firing a button beneath the menu strip. PRESS, RELEASE and DRAG always stop the
            propagation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Still, containers can override the method boolean <code>containerPreItemsMouseEvent(int x, int y)</code>
            which is called
            before the event is passed on to the children and if returns false, will prevent the children from receiving
            the event. Scroll containers i.e. use this to implement a scroll bar.
        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned above, containers use the method <code>renderItem(Control c, int x, int y)</code>. This method
            also stores
            the given x and y in the elements properties <code>offsetX</code> and <code>offsetY</code>. These are the
            actual coordinates relative
            to the parent and they are the ones that are checked when this element receives a mouse event and it needs
            to decide whether the mouse is within itself or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a container receives a mouse event (parent calls <code>mouseEvent(int x, int y)</code>), it passes x
            and y on to the
            children but subtracting the own offset coordinates. During setup <code>Frame</code> registers a
            <code>mouseEvent(MouseEvent)</code>
            method at Processings <code>PApplet</code>. This is called by <code>PApplet</code> before draw() each time
            there is a new mouse event.
            <code>Frame</code> then starts the mouse event propagation within <b>guiSET</b>. The <code>MouseEvent</code>
            object is stored in
            the static
            field <code>Control.currentMouseEvent</code>, is not passed around while the event is recursively handled
            but every
            element can access it.
        </p>









        <h1 id="s5">Events in general</h1>
        <p>
            The programmer can add certain listeners to his objects. Mouse listeners are available for all classes. They
            can be assigned and given a callback method
            with the <code>addMouseListener()</code> method, specifying the type with a string
            ("press", "release"...). If no target is specified with the overloaded
            <code>addMouseListener() </code>method, papplet will be assumed.
        </p>
        <p>
            How MouseListener works: <code>Frame</code> registers a <code>mouseEvent()</code> method at
            <code>PApplet</code>.
            Every container (also <code>Frame</code>) calls the mouseEvent for all its items. When an
            element gets a mouseEvent, it can decide to stop the propagation by calling
            <code>stopPropagation()</code>. This way elements with high z-index, which will be checked
            first and can prevent lower elements from getting the mouseEvent. This is
            needed for example with menus, spinners, popups etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            Moreover classes like <code>Frame</code> and <code>Textbox</code> feature key listeners or an
            itemchanged-listener (<code>ListView</code>, <code>MenuItem</code>). These listeners are usually
            assigned with extra methods like <code>addItemChangeListener()</code> etc.
        </p>

        <h2>
            How to make an event listener in a new class
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In the class, create an EventListener with an appropriate name (don't initialize it)</li>
            <li>Provide adding and removing methods</li>
            <li>Also provide a simple adding method that defaults target to papplet (the sketch)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            An example with no arguments.
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
protected EventListener myListener;
public void addMyListener(String methodName, Object target) {
    myListener = createEventListener(methodName, target, null);
}
public void addMyListener(String methodName) {
    addMyListener(methodName, getPApplet());
}
public void removeMyListener(){
    myListener = null; // setting listener to null is the way to do it
}
protected void someFunctionThatChangesObervedState(){
    // do stuff
    handleEvent(myListener, null);
}</pre>
        <p>
            An example with arguments (in this case a <code>MouseEvent</code>)
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
protected EventListener myListener;
public void addMyListener(String methodName, Object target) {
myListener = createEventListener(methodName, target, MouseEvent.class);
}
public void addMyListener(String methodName) {
addMyListener(methodName, getPApplet());
}
public void removeMyListener(){
myListener = null; // setting listener to null is the way to do it
}
protected void someFunctionThatChangesObervedState(){
// do stuff
MouseEvent eventThatWeGotFromSomewhere;
handleEvent(myListener, eventThatWeGotFromSomewhere);
}</pre>

        <p>
            If arguments shall be passed to the callback function, then pass their
            class to the <code>createEventListener()</code> method as third argument. When handling
            the event, pass the argument here.
